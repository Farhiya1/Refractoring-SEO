# Refractoring-SEO

<!--Why did I build this project-->
Reconstructing existing code for better accessibility, with the intention to create clarity, improve code readability and design for a digital marketing website.

<!--Motivation behind this?-->
Working on existing code provides me with the learning opportunity to better understand the structure and content of a html and css document. (Although changes were only made on the html document, I was able to understand that depending on the changes made, the css document can also be affected. Therefore, throughout this process I made sure to keep an eye out on the css stylesheet)

<!--What does this project solve?-->
Making the changes that I have made, allows for better accesibilty and optimises what the website intends which is Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). The changes made provide context clarity for anyone who views this code, but also sements the concept of SEO by utlising the best key words possible.


<!--How was this achieved?-->
I have used the green comment above each changes made to the original code to explain why.

<!--Example of this?-->
You can find an example in the HTML file on line #17 where the following comment was added above the <nav> element. "<!-- Changes: Addded nav instead of div for better clarity -->"

<!--Criteria set to achieve this are the following:-->

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards 
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of 
styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

<!-- Examples of Criteria achieved?-->

1. For the criteria " WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes"

I added an alt attribute as there were none to act as a placeholder for each image. 

2. For the criteria "WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title"

I added a concise descriptive title in replacement of "website" as "Digital Marketing Optimisation"

3. For the Criteria "WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements"

I added semantic html elements such as 'nav','section','main','header','footer',and 'aside' instead of the element that was used repetively 'div'
